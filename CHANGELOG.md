- Improve some minor details in the documentation and in the README (notably to refer to the [contour-isobands](https://github.com/mthh/contour-isobands-rs) crate)

### 0.8.0 (2023-02-21)

- Be less restrictive about the geo-types version and use geo_types::Coord instead of deprecated geo_types::Coordinate.

### 0.7.0 (2022-09-23)

- BREAKING: Make geojson optional, use geo-types for geometry representation
  (thanks to @michaelkirk, see #5 and #6 for details).

- BREAKING: Rename the "value" field to "threshold" in the GeoJSON representation.

- Add `x_origin`, `y_origin`, `x_step` and `y_step`

  the `contours` method.
